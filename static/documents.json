What does it do? Uses multi - threading to load data in parallel while keeping the primary thread free for the training loop Handles batching and collating Is simple to extend for custom datasets Integrates well with other packages in the ecosystem Allows for inplace loading to reduce memory load When should you use it? You have a dataset that does not fit into memory You want to reduce the time your training loop is waiting for the next batch of data How do you use it? Install like any other Julia package using the package manager (see  setup ): ] add  DataLoaders After installation, import it, create a  DataLoader  from a dataset and batch size, and iterate over it: using  DataLoaders\n# 10.000 observations of inputs with 128 features and one target feature\n data  =  ( rand ( 128 ,  10000 ) ,  rand ( 1 ,  10000 ) )\n dataloader  =  DataLoader ( data ,  16 )\n\n for  ( xs ,  ys )  in  dataloader\n     @assert   size ( xs )  ==  ( 128 ,  16 )\n     @assert   size ( ys )  ==  ( 1 ,  16 )\n end Next, you may want to read What datasets you can use it with How it compares to PyTorch ’ s data loader"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/DataLoaders.batchviewcollated","title":"batchviewcollated","text":""},{"doctype":"document","id":"documents/docs/howto/workingwith.md","title":"workingwith","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/DataLoaders.WorkerPool","title":"WorkerPool","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/DataLoaders.DataLoader","title":"DataLoader","text":" DataLoader (\n     data ,\n     batchsize  =  1;\n     partial  =  true ,\n     collate  =  true ,\n     buffered  =  collate ,\n     parallel  =  Threads . nthreads ( )  >  1 ,\n     useprimary  =  false ,\n ) Create an efficient iterator of batches over  data container   data .

The basic usage for both is  DataLoader(dataset, batchsize) , but for other use cases there are some differences .

See  DataLoader  for a full list of its arguments . dataset : This package currently only supports map - style datasets which work similarly to Python ’ s, but instead of implementing  __getindex__  and  __len__ , you ’ d implement  LearnBase.getobs  and  nobs .   More info here . batch_size = 1 : If not specified otherwise, the default batch size is 1 for both packages .  In DataLoaders . jl, you can additionally pass in  nothing  to turn off batching . shuffle = false : This package ’ s  DataLoader  does  not  support this argument .  Shuffling should be applied to the dataset beforehand .  See  working with data containers . collate_fn : DataLoaders . jl collates batches by default unless  collate = false  is passed .  A custom collate function is not supported, but you can extend  DataLoaders.collate  for custom data types for the same effect . drop_last = False .  DataLoaders . jl has the same behavior of returning a partial batch by default, but the keyword argument is  partial = false  with  partial = not drop_last . prefetch_factor : This cannot be customized currently .  The default behavior for DataLoaders . jl is for every thread to be preloading one batch . pin_memory : DataLoaders . jl does not interact with the GPU, but you can do this in your data container . num_workers ,  persistent_workers ,  worker_init_fn ,  timeout : Unlike PyTorch, this package does not use multiprocessing, but multithreading which is not practical in Python due to the GIL .  As such these arguments do not apply .

We call such a dataset a  data container  and it needs to support the following operations: getobs(data, i)  loads the  i - th observation from a dataset nobs(data)  gives the number of observations in a dataset . Basic data containers The simplest data container is a vector of values: using  DataLoaders\n @show   v  =  rand ( 1 : 10 ,  10 )\n @show   nobs ( v )\n getobs ( v ,  1 ) v = rand(1:10, 10) = [7, 2, 7, 6, 7, 10, 1, 8, 7, 9]\nnobs(v) = 10\n Multi - dimensional arrays also work, with the last dimension treated as the observation dimension: a  =  rand ( 50 ,  50 ,  10 )\n summary ( getobs ( a ,  1 ) )  50×50 Matrix{Float64} You can also group multiple data containers with the same length together by putting them into a  Tuple : data  =  ( v ,  a )\n getobs ( data ,  1 )  You can pass any data container to  DataLoader  to create an iterator over batches: for  batch  in  DataLoader ( v ,  2 )\n     @assert   size ( batch )  ==  ( 2 , )\n end\n\n for  batch  in  DataLoader ( a ,  2 ) \n     @assert   size ( batch )  ==  ( 50 ,  50 ,  2 )\n end\n\n for  ( vs ,  as )  in  DataLoader ( ( v ,  a ) ,  2 ) \n     @assert   size ( vs )  ==  ( 2 , )\n     @assert   size ( as )  ==  ( 50 ,  50 ,  2 )\n end Out - of - memory data containers Arrays, of course, are kept in memory, so we (1) cannot use them to store larger - than - memory datasets (2) don ’ t need to use multithreading since loading an observation just involves indexing an array which is generally fast . One way to quickly get into the territory of too - large - to - fit in memory is to work with image datasets .  So instead of loading every image of a dataset into an array, we ’ ll implement a data container that stores only the file names of each image .  It will load the image itself only when  getobs  is called .  To do that we ’ ll implement a  struct  that stores a vector of file names, and implement  getobs  and  nobs  for that type . import  DataLoaders . LearnBase :  getobs ,  nobs\n using  Images\n\n struct   ImageDataset\n     files :: Vector { String }\n end\n ImageDataset ( folder :: String )  =  ImageDataset ( readdir ( folder ) )\n\n nobs ( data :: ImageDataset )  =  length ( data . files )\n getobs ( data :: ImageDataset ,  i :: Int )  =  Images . load ( data . files [ i ] ) Now, if we have a folder full of images, we can create a data container and load them quickly into batches as follows: data  =  ImageDataset ( \"path/to/my/images\" )\n for  images  in  DataLoader ( data ,  16 ,  collate  =  false )\n    # Do something\n  end Preprocessing Above we pass the  collate = false  argument because images may be of different sizes that cannot be collated .  See  collate .  In practice, it is common to apply some cropping and resizing to images so that they all have the same size . Threads To use  DataLoaders ’  multi - threading, you need to start Julia with multiple threads .  Check the number of available threads with  Threads.nthreads() ."},{"doctype":"document","id":"documents/docs/interface.md","title":"Data container interface","text":" Data container interface"}]
