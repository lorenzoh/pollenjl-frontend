        "text": " Data containers Introduction to data containers giving an overview over the kinds of datasets you can use DataLoaders . jl is built to integrate with the further ecosystem and builds on a common interface to support datasets .  We call such a dataset a  data container  and it needs to support the following operations: getobs(data, i)  loads the  i - th observation from a dataset nobs(data)  gives the number of observations in a dataset . Basic data containers The simplest data container is a vector of values: using   DataLoaders \n @show    v   =  rand ( 1 : 10 ,  10 )\n @show    nobs ( v )\n getobs ( v ,  1 ) v = rand(1:10, 10) = [10, 3, 2, 2, 4, 7, 3, 1, 7, 5]\nnobs(v) = 10\n Multi - dimensional arrays also work, with the last dimension treated as the observation dimension: a   =  rand ( 50 ,  50 ,  10 )\n summary ( getobs ( a ,  1 ) )  50×50 Matrix{Float64} You can also group multiple data containers with the same length together by putting them into a  Tuple : data   =  ( v ,  a )\n getobs ( data ,  1 )  You can pass any data container to  DataLoader  to create an iterator over batches: for   batch   in  DataLoader ( v ,  2 )\n     @assert    size ( batch )  ==  ( 2 , )\n end \n\n for   batch   in  DataLoader ( a ,  2 ) \n     @assert    size ( batch )  ==  ( 50 ,  50 ,  2 )\n end \n\n for   ( vs ,  as )  in  DataLoader ( ( v ,  a ) ,  2 ) \n     @assert    size ( vs )  ==  ( 2 , )\n     @assert    size ( as )  ==  ( 50 ,  50 ,  2 )\n end Out - of - memory data containers Arrays, of course, are kept in memory, so we (1) cannot use them to store larger - than - memory datasets (2) don ’ t need to use multithreading since loading an observation just involves indexing an array which is generally fast . One way to quickly get into the territory of too - large - to - fit in memory is to work with image datasets .  So instead of loading every image of a dataset into an array, we ’ ll implement a data container that stores only the file names of each image .  It will load the image itself only when  getobs  is called .  To do that we ’ ll implement a  struct  that stores a vector of file names, and implement  getobs  and  nobs  for that type . import   DataLoaders . LearnBase :  getobs ,  nobs \n using   Images \n\n struct    ImageDataset \n     files :: Vector { String }\n end \n ImageDataset ( folder :: String )  =  ImageDataset ( readdir ( folder ) )\n\n nobs ( data :: ImageDataset )  =  length ( data . files )\n getobs ( data :: ImageDataset ,  i :: Int )  =  Images . load ( data . files [ i ] ) Now, if we have a folder full of images, we can create a data container and load them quickly into batches as follows: data   =  ImageDataset ( \"path/to/my/images\" )\n for   images   in  DataLoader ( data ,  16 ,  collate   =  false )\n    # Do something\n  end Preprocessing Above we pass the  collate = false  argument because images may be of different sizes that cannot be collated .  See  collate .  In practice, it is common to apply some cropping and resizing to images so that they all have the same size . Threads To use  DataLoaders ’  multi - threading, you need to start Julia with multiple threads .  Check the number of available threads with  Threads.nthreads() ."

See  DataLoader  for a full list of its arguments . dataset : This package currently only supports map - style datasets which work similarly to Python ’ s, but instead of implementing  __getindex__  and  __len__ , you ’ d implement  LearnBase.getobs  and  nobs .   More info here . batch_size = 1 : If not specified otherwise, the default batch size is 1 for both packages .  In DataLoaders . jl, you can additionally pass in  nothing  to turn off batching . shuffle = false : This package ’ s  DataLoader  does  not  support this argument .  Shuffling should be applied to the dataset beforehand .  See  working with data containers . collate_fn : DataLoaders . jl collates batches by default unless  collate = false  is passed .  A custom collate function is not supported, but you can extend  DataLoaders.collate  for custom data types for the same effect . drop_last = False .  DataLoaders . jl has the same behavior of returning a partial batch by default, but the keyword argument is  partial = false  with  partial = not drop_last . prefetch_factor : This cannot be customized currently .  The default behavior for DataLoaders . jl is for every thread to be preloading one batch . pin_memory : DataLoaders . jl does not interact with the GPU, but you can do this in your data container . num_workers ,  persistent_workers ,  worker_init_fn ,  timeout : Unlike PyTorch, this package does not use multiprocessing, but multithreading which is not practical in Python due to the GIL .  As such these arguments do not apply .  Currently, DataLoaders . jl will use either all threads except the primary one or all threads based on the keyword argument  useprimary = false . sampler ,  batch_sampler ,  generator : This package does not currently support these arguments for customizing the randomness ."

DataLoaders . jl provides the  collate  function for this: DataLoaders . collate ( batch )  As you can see, the batch dimension is the last one by default . Nested observations The above case only shows how to collate observations that each consist of a single array .  In practice, however, observations will often consist of multiple variables like input features and a target variable .  For example, we could have an integer indicating the class of an input sample . inputs   =  rand ( 2 ,  100 )\n targets   =  rand ( 1 : 10 ,  100 )\n data   =  ( inputs ,  targets )\n batch   =  [ getobs ( data ,  i )  for   i   in  1 : 4 ]  Collating here also works, by keeping the tuple structure and collating each element separately: DataLoaders . collate ( batch )  This is also implemented for  NamedTuple s and  Dict s .  You can also collate nested structures, e . g .  a  Tuple  of  Dict s and the structure is preserved .  This also works when using  inplace loading ."
